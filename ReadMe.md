In this project I made a neural network that tries to predict if a text should be black or white for a random background color.
You can find some sample data in "ExampleData.txt", copy and paste it in the data part of the script.js.
You can also train the network yourself with the White or Black button. Press the one that you find best fitting and the network will keep it in mind for further colors.

In the Archive folder there are a few previous steps I took before I end up with this prototype.
